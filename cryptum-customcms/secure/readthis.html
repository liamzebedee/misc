The chat is completely annonymous and only stores the messages and their number. No date, IP or name is stored.<br>
I <b>WILL NOT</b> be adding names for this reason to keep everyone and thing annonymous so dont ask me to.<br>
I have taken into thought that people will want to reply to messages. As I will not be implementing users I<br>
will not implement personal messaging. The format to reply to a message is this format-<br><i>@messagenumber your message</i><br>
Further and foremost this site has no censoring and will never have any censoring<br><br>
Probs should add this-<br>
