Q: Whenever I try to access your scipt it opens up with Internet Explorer/Dreamweaver/Notepad/etc.
   What the hell is going on?
A: You need to upload the script with the rest of the files to a PHP-enabled webserver. The script
   cannot be run locally simply by clicking on the files themselves. Read the Installation part of the README.txt.

Q: Can this script run on a free web host (i.e. lycos.co.uk, host.sk, etc.)?
A: Highly unlikely. Since safe_mode is turned On for nearly all free web hosts. And having it Off
   is essential for this script to function.

Q: File uploads won't work??!?!11
A: Make sure that file_uploads is turned On in your server's php.ini file.

Q: I have another problem with the script that isn't covered here.
A: 1. Make sure you have the latest version of the script properly installed.
   2. Read the README.txt
   3. Read this FAQ again.
   If all of the above fails to solve your problem, send me an email or post a question at the forums.
