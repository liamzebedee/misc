<b>Introduction</b>
My name is Liam Edwards-Playne. My dev name is liamzebedee. I am a 13yr old programmer. I program mainly in these web languages <br>

<li>PHP
<li>HTML
<li>CSL
<br>
I do also though program in Java and C# for applications and games. My programming started when I was 11/12 and I wanted to get onto YouTube at school. From there started my journey as a Batch programmer(.bat). I found batch simple yet powerful. In just 20 characters or 3 lines of code I could put a computer into a loop which would result in the user having to do a force Manuel shutdown. Batch was also useful because it didn't require compilation and was compatible with basically all versions of windows.. As it had been native to windows since the dos ages it could run on any modern windows machine.
<br>
<b> The age of GML</b> <br>
I started getting interested in other languages after 2months. My only other programmer friend who programmer with me started learning C++. I became interested in Game Maker and it's language- Game Maker Language. It was my first object-orientated programming experience.It also was my first GUI dev. At that time I didn't know of Java/Visual studio so this was pretty awesome.
