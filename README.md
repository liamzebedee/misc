# Misc
Here is a collection of miscellaneous code I've written for projects that are now redundant. If no license is stated, consider it to be GPLv2 (you can contact me if you have any issues). 

WARNING: THIS CODE IS EVIDENT OF MY DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING. IT IS SOME OF THE MOST SCRAPPY AND UGLIEST CODE EVER WRITTEN. BROWSE WITH CAUTION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 

## Guide (somewhat chronological)
* [cryptum-customcms/](misc/tree/master/cryptum-customcms/) - The original Cryptum Content Management System as of the 10th of April 2011 (not the last version however). I have removed all private-keys/SQL-data by the way. There are some neat things here though.
* [java-lessur/](misc/tree/master/java-lessur/) - Game I was developing for quite some time. I got too stuck on developing the engine that nothing really happened. However I did contribute many libraries and helper classes to the community while I was developing, so it was a pretty good learning experience, and I suppose I did achieve something. 
* [java_roguelike/](misc/tree/master/java_roguelike/) - Same as above, except I was using some cool tricks in my code (see my code for the flamethrower particle effect). 
* [rawdata/](misc/tree/master/rawdata/) - UNFINISHED Minimalistic WordPress theme based off Automattic's tutorials.
* [cryptum-metro/](misc/tree/master/cryptum-metro/) - UNFINISHED simplistic Wordpess theme with a lot of design concepts taken from Windows 8 Metro UI
* [python-p2p-scrape/](misc/tree/master/python-p2p-scrape/) - A Google intolerant script I wrote to scrape academic papers from IEEE website and then try download them by searching Google for the appropriate title
* [java_eclipse-plugin_sharpdev/](misc/tree/master/java_eclipse-plugin_sharpdev/) - A semi-working port of the SharpDev (enables people to code in C# in Eclipse + Mono) to Mono/.NET 4.0
