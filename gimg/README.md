# GIMG
**gimg** is an addon I've developed for Anki that made my language learning more productive. When learning a language, it's good to memorise the concepts, rather than the translations. Previous to gimg, I would search Google for an image that would match the word I'm studying (i.e. looking for a picture of a dog) and copy this image into Anki. The problem with this approach is that I can't search for the flashcards anymore and that if I don't know what the original word behind the image is I am stuck. 

gimg is the automated solution to these problems. Licensed under GPLv3. 

## Usage
When adding a card, a button should be shown titled "Load image". After typing the word on the front of the card (cat), click this button. A window should appear, with a list of 15 images that have been returned from the Google Image search for "cat". Click on one of the images and it will be inserted into the card. 

When reviewing, if you don't know what an image represents, hover over it to read the title.

When searching for cards, simply type in the title.
