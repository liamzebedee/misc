Forrest site.xml

This file contains an outline of the site's information content.  It is used to:
- Generate the website menus (though these can be overridden - see docs)
- Provide semantic, location-independent aliases for internal 'site:' URIs, eg
<link href="site:changes"> links to changes.html (or ../changes.html if in
  subdir).
- Provide aliases for external URLs in the external-refs section.  Eg, <link
  href="ext:cocoon"> links to http://cocoon.apache.org/ 

See http://forrest.apache.org/docs/linking.html for more info

   <!-- Note: No matter what you configure here, Forrest will always try to load
       index.html when you request http://yourHost/.
       'How can I use a start-up-page other than index.html?' in the FAQs has more 
       information tells you how to change that.
