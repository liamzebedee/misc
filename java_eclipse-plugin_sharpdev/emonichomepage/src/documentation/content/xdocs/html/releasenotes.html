The file You want to download is emonic.zip. 
Copy it in Your eclipse-folder and unzip it there. 
The emonicinformator.exe - file is a .net-tool which You can 
use to query .net-assembly. Emonic uses it for 
command-line-completions. You can download it here, 
but there is also a version in the pluginfolder under /net.

<p>
To get this part to work, set the corresponding command in
the emono preferences to it (e.g. PATH/emonicinformator.exe
under win, mono PATH/emonicinformator.exe on all others)
