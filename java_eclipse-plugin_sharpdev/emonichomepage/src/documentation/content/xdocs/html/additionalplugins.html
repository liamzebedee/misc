<h1>Additional Plugins</h1>

<p>There are some additional plugins to work with emonic available. They have various status of stability and functionality</p>

<br>
<h2>emonic.base.build.ant</h2>
<table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Stability</td><td>Short Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>emonic.base.build.ant</td><td>Beta</td><td>Ant-BuildMechanism</td></tr></table>
<p>
The ant build mechanism allows You to use the with eclipse shipped "java"-Ant for building .net applications. 
We separated it in an extra plugin to avoid the dependency to the java-development-framework of eclipse (i.e. You can 
now use the C++ - eclipse-distribution for emonic if You don't require this build mechanism)
</p> 
<h2>org.emonic.debugger</h2>
<table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Stability</td><td>Short Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>org.emonic.debugger</td><td>Alpha</td><td>A debugger for mono</td></tr></table>
<p>A debugger based on the mono mcs debugger. You can only debug code based on mono - no microsoft .net code. 
The debugger consists on 2 parts: A web service which provides the "debugging service" and a plugin for emonic 
which calls the web service. Since the mcs- debugger was not very stable in the last years, this plugin might 
work not with every mono-version.

This plugin comes with patched mcs-libraries for <it>linux</it>. For all other platforms You have to rebuild 
this libraries from cvs.
<h2>emonic.base.build.csant</h2>
<table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Stability</td><td>Short Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>emonic.base.build.csant</td><td>Alpha</td><td>CSAnt-Support for emonic</td></tr></table>
<p>
CSant is the build-System of the dotgnu-framework (http://dotgnu.org). This plugin enables You to work with 
the build mechanism of this framework.
</p>
<h2>org.emonic.debug.remote</h2>
<table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Stability</td><td>Short Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>org.emonic.debug.remote</td><td>Alpha</td><td>Remote-Application-starter for emonic</td></tr></table>
<p>
Despite its name, this is no debugger! It is a framework for starting .net-applications remote. 
It requires the org.eclipse.rse-plugins.
