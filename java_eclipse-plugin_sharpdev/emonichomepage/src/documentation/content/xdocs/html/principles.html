The development of this project is based on the following rules:
<ul>
<li>The development is (at this time) based on the infrastructure of sourceforge. This means the sourceforge project is the communication platform and the central code depot of this project</li> 
<li>The code as well as the documentation are in the cvs-revision-control-system of sourceforge</li>
<li>For each version published officially the code has to be tagged in the repository</li>
<li>For each bug and each new feature has to be opened a ticket in the sourceforge-tracker</li>
<li>The documentation contains a changelog describing the changes from version to version. This changelog contains the ticket numbers of the tracker and a short description. The changelog has to be adapted to each official release.</li>
<li>The documentation contains the release notes. They have to be adapted to each official release.</li>
<li>All versions of the plugin less or equal version 1.0 has to run under eclipse 3.2 and java 1.4
