This are the sources of the help manual and the web site of emonic. 
They use apache forrest - see  http://forrest.apache.org/

To build the emonic help manual You must have the project in the same
eclipse workspace like emonic.base, adapt the path in build-manual.sh
and run it. 

To build the web site, You have to adapt the build-website.sh and run it. This will result
in a file emonicsite.tar.gz containing the docs of the web site
